--When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When your work is complete, to share with others, to work remotely without carrying all you files around like in a thumbdrive.

--Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

you might have different people working on the files from the same or remote locations.
